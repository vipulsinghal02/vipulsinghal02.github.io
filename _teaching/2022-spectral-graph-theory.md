In 2022-early 2023, Dr Hwee Kuan Lee at the Bioinformatics Institute taught an internal course on graph deep learning. I helped teach a submodule within this course on the graph fourier transform and spectral graph neural networks. You can find some of the slides [here](/files/SpectralGraphNeuralNets_Jan2023.pdf).
