Between August 2022 and Feb 2023, Dr Hwee Kuan Lee at the Bioinformatics Institute taught a course on graph neural networks to researchers at A\*STAR. I helped teach a submodule within this course on the graph fourier transform and spectral graph convolution neural networks. You can find some of the slides [here](/files/SpectralGraphNeuralNets_Jan2023.pdf). 

Broadly speaking, we covered the notion of signals on graphs, the relationship between the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian and the structure of the graph, the notion of a fourier transfrom on a graph, and that of the convolution operation (via the FT), and finally the idea of graph convolutional neural networks. See the slides for details.
