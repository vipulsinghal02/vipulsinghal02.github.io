Over the years, I have had the opportunity to mentor and work with various students. Here is a list of their projects. 

#### GIS
* Jeena Kataria (GIS, Singapore, Jan - July 2024)

#### Caltech
* **Xianglin Meng** (Oxford, UK, 2015). Flora managed to [publish a paper](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0157) from the work she did during the three months she was in our lab in Caltech. Her work was on finding stationary solutions to the chemical master equation (CME) by gluing graphs representing CME state spaces. 
* **Cody Dunn** (Cal State University, Long Beach, USA, 2015). Cody worked on methods for identifying bimodality in distributions arising from solutions of the CME (via the stochastic simulation algorithm, for example) chemical reaction networks. 
* **Ronnie Rodrigues Pereira** (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden), 2015. Identifiability analysis (using the GenSSI toolbox) and MCMC based parameter estimation for mass action models of synthetic genetic circuits. 
* **Anushka Rau** (Caltech, USA), **Enrique Amaya** (Mexico), 2015; **Anton Frisk** (Lund University, Sweden), **Pulkit Malik** (University of Maryland, USA), **Tiffany Zhou** (Caltech, USA), 2014. These interns worked on wet lab and dry lab characterization of genetic circuits (IFFL, bistable switch, and the characterization of various combinatorial promoters) in cell free systems over 2014-2015.
