Between February and November 2023, I assisted Dr Hwee Kuan Lee in teaching a course on differential geometry to AI researchers in Singapore's Agency for Science Technology and Research.  

We covered the following topics over a period of about 8 months:
* Vectors, one forms/covectors, 
* Covariant and contravariant tensors, Christoffel symbols, the metric tensor
* Differentiable manifolds, charts, tangent plane/bundle, vector fields
* The covariant derivative, parallel transport, and the geodesic
* Pushforwards and pullbacks of vectors, one forms and tensors
* Flow, Lie derivative, Lie bracket
