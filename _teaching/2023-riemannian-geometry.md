From Mar - Nov 2023, I helped run the tutorial sessions to supplement the main class schedule of a differential geometry course taught by Dr Hwee Kuan at the Bioinformatics Institute in Singapore. We covered the following topics over a period of about 8 months:

* Vectors, one forms/covectors, covariant and contravariant tensors
* Manifolds, charts, tangent plane/bundle, vector field
* Christoffel symbols, the covariant derivative, parallel transport, and the geodesic
* Pushforwards and pullbacks of vectors, one forms and tensors
* Flow, Lie derivative, Lie bracket
