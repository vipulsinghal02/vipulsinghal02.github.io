Course overview, gene circuit dynamics
* Rate equations enable analysis of gene regulation circuits
* Degradation rates control response times in simple open-loop gene regulation
* Autoregulatory feedback loops modulate the response times of genetic circuits, limit variability, and can enable rate-responsive systems
* Cooperative responses can enable switch-like regulation and bistability
* Circuit motifs can help identify functional modules in complex circuits
