I TA'd a course called Design Principles for Genetic Circuits in 2014 and 2015. 
In 2014, the course was taught by Richard Murray and Michael Elowitz. You can access the link to the course webpage for 2014 [here](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/index.php/BE_150/Bi_250_Spring_2014)

The course covered the following topics, among others: 
* Rate equations enable analysis of gene regulation circuits
* Degradation rates control response times in simple open-loop gene regulation
* Autoregulatory feedback loops modulate the response times of genetic circuits, limit variability, and can enable rate-responsive systems
* Cooperative responses can enable switch-like regulation and bistability
* Circuit motifs can help identify functional modules in complex circuits
