I am a researcher at the Genome Institute of Singapore in Dr Kok Hao Chen's [lab](https://khchenlab.github.io/), where I work on developing new algorithms for spatial multi omics data analysis. I did my [PhD](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/11161/) in Professor [Richard Murray's [lab](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page) in the intersection of control and synthetic biology, and my undergrad in electrical engineering at Imperial. 

### Current projects
We recently developed BANKSY, which is a spatial clustering method for genomics data. It uses both the transcriptomic features of cells, along with their relative spatial locations, to construct a graph in an embedding space, which is then clustered using community detection algorithms. The paper will appear in Nature Genetics shortly, and in the meantime, you can read the biorxiv post from a couple of years ago [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.14.488259v1.full), and play with the code [here](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/Banksy/). 

A slightly more theory-based project involves developing parameter consistency conditions for composing dynamical models of systems, with applications in synthetic biology. The application we have demonstrated it on is the reduction of batch variability in cell free systems. You can read more about this work in the current draft of the [manuscript](/files/calibration_2024.pdf). 

I have also developed a MATLAB toolbox for modeling and composing genetic circuits, and for performing parameter inference in these models using MCMC. You can read the paper [here](https://academic.oup.com/synbio/article/6/1/ysab007/6129121). 

### Academic interests
I am currently interested in developing graph deep learning enabled embedding methods for multi-omics data. In some sense, this would generalize BANKSY to multi-omics, and to capture more complex patterns in the data. I am also interested in developing a description of parameteric uncertainty in models of gene regulatory networks. 

In the long run, I am broadly interested in working on planning and reasoning using structured world models, especially in a neuroscience inspired way.
