**Talk Abstract**
I will introduce a spatial clustering algorithm named BANKSY, which applies to any spatial (RNA/protein/...) assay, scales to 2M cells, and accurately detects both cell types and spatial domains. BANKSY operates on the philosophy that 'a cell is known by the company it keeps' and works by embedding cells in a product space of neighborhood transcriptome features (expression mean, texture) and the cell's own transcriptome. We will discuss various applications of this approach, ranging from spatial cell typing to domain segmentation, and even spatial batch correction.
