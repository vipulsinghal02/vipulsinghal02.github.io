Identification of cell-types in tissue is an important task in spatial omics, and is critical for understanding function and disease etiology. We present BANKSY, a biologically motivated algorithm that uses both spatial and transcriptomic information to cluster cell-types and tissue domains in spatial omics data. We show that BANKSY is accurate, robust, scalable, and applicable to diverse sample types and spatial technologies.
