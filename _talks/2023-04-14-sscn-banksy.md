I have presented the BANKSY clustering algorithm at several meetings, including the Singapore Single Cell Network Meeting in 2023, the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology conference in 2022, the [Human Cell Atlas Asia meeting](https://youtu.be/MeddQqZRCiM?si=kqeYI3ugBbbDs6LN&t=6390)  in 2021, and internal GIS seminars. Here is a description of the work, some slides, and link to youtube videos. 

**Talk abstract:**

Identification of cell-types in tissue is an important task in spatial omics, and is critical for understanding function and disease etiology. We present BANKSY, a biologically motivated algorithm that uses both spatial and transcriptomic information to cluster cell-types and tissue domains in spatial omics data. We show that BANKSY is accurate, robust, scalable, and applicable to diverse sample types and spatial technologies.
