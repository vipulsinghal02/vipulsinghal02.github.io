We present an algorithm for spatially informed unsupervised clustering of cells, named Building Aggregates with a Neighbourhood Kernel and Spatial Yardstick (BANKSY), which can operate on any type of spatial omics data. BANKSY incorporates information from a cell's immediate microenvironment into its omics profile to produce a combined feature set for clustering and cell typing. We show that this method can be applied to multiplexed fluorescence in-situ hybridization data and Slide-Seq data to improve performance on noisy data, clarify regional boundaries and detect cell sub-types with similar omics profiles but varying microenvironment signatures.
